Handle async with createAsyncThunk
--------------------------------------------


Basics of React (useState, props, useEffect)
[

    - useState : Used to manage local component state. like count functionallity 
    - props : Used to pass data from parent to child component.
    - useEffect : Runs side-effects like API calls or logging
]


Set up a store with configureStore
[
   - install dependenci : npm install @reduxjs/toolkit react-redux
    Why?
    To keep all your app's global data in one place, instead of passing props deeply.

    🧾 Example:

    Shopping cart data

    Logged-in user info

    App theme (light/dark)

    🛠️ It's like: A school notice board — every classroom (component) can read/write to it.




  -🧠 5. createSlice() – Divide State into Modules
    Why?
    To organize your state and actions in one place:
    State + Reducers + Actions = Slice

    🧾 Example:

    counterSlice for counter logic

    authSlice for login/register

    🛠️ It's like: Keeping maths homework and science homework in different notebooks 📒
